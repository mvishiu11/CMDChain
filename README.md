# CMDChain - Your LLM Command Line Agent

Welcome to **CMDChain**! This little project combines the magic of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the humble command line, giving you a server-based agent that can execute command line commands right from an API request. If you've ever wanted to tell a computer to do your bidding in plain language, you've found the right place.

## What Does CMDChain Do?

CMDChain lets you:

- **Talk to Your Server**: Send natural language instructions like, "Find all `.txt` files in a folder and rename the ones with the word 'log' to `.log` files."
- **Simple Command Line Control**: Navigate the file system, create, read, or modify filesâ€”all by chatting with your agent.
- **Interact through API**: Use FastAPI/Flask to send JSON requests and get JSON responses. Easy peasy.

## Tech Stack

Here's what keeps CMDChain running smoothly:

- **Python**: The core language for this project.
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: For building the LLM-based agent.
- **FastAPI/Flask**: To create the server that provides the API.
- **Google AI Studio** (or your LLM of choice): For powering the agent itself.
- **Poetry**: To keep those pesky dependencies in check.

## Features

- Asynchronous request handling. Because who has time to wait?
- Handles JSON requests and responses for easy integration.
- Makes use of command line tools to fulfill complex instructions.
- Passes all **mypy** and **pylint** checks, and formatted with **black** (you know, because we're professionals).

## Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Poetry** for dependency management (recommended)
- A working internet connection (to connect to your LLM of choice)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvishiu11/CMDChain.git
   cd CMDChain
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   poetry run server
   ```

4. You're ready to send some commands! ðŸŽ‰

### Example Request

Send a POST request to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/agent` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "msg": "Find all files in directory 'my_dir' with .txt extension. For those containing the word 'log', change their extension to .log."
}
```

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:8000/agent" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"msg": "Change extension of all files in 'test' dir with .txt extension to .log extension."}'
```

The agent will use command line tools to do its best to fulfill your request.

Example response:

```json
{"response":"some.txt\nsomev2.txt\n\n\n\nFile moved successfully from test/some.txt to test/some.log.\n\nFile moved successfully from test/somev2.txt to test/somev2.log.\n\nsome.log\nother.pdf\nsomev2.log\nAll .txt files with the word \"log\" in their content have been changed to have the .log extension in the test directory."}
```

```
some.txt
somev2.txt

File moved successfully from test/some.txt to test/some.log.
File moved successfully from test/somev2.txt to test/somev2.log.

some.log
other.pdf
somev2.log

All .txt files with the word "log" in their content have been changed to have the .log extension in the test directory.
```

Which translates to:

- The agent found two files in the `test` directory with the `.txt` extension.
- It successfully changed their extensions to `.log`.
- It then listed all files in the directory, showing the changes made.

### API Overview

- **Endpoint**: `/agent`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: JSON containing a `msg` field (string)
- **Response**: JSON containing the result or error message

## Running Tests

Testing is always a good idea. Make sure everything's working with:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Final Thoughts

CMDChain is a fun way to bring natural language control to the command line. We hope you enjoy tinkering with it as much as we enjoyed building it!

If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
